      "of interaction with IPython: this web-based interface allows you to execute Python and IPython\n",
      "commands in each input cell just like you would at the IPython terminal or Qt console, but you can\n",

      "\n",
      "The document you are reading now is precisely an example of one such notebooks, and we will show you\n",
      "here how to best use this new interface.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing to understand is that the user interface of the notebook is now **modal**. In a modal user interface, there are different modes of keyboard inputs. The notebook has two modes:\n",
      "\n",
      "* `Edit mode`: for typing into a cell\n",
      "* `Command mode`: for performing notebook and cell actions\n",
      "\n",
      "The second one is that a notebook consists of a sequence of 'cells' that can contain \n",
      "either text (such as this one) or code meant for execution (such as the next one):\n",
      "\n",
      "* `Markdown cells` can be written using [Markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). \n",
      "When a Markdown cell is executed, the Markdown code is converted into the corresponding formatted rich text. You can also include mathematics using standard LaTeX notation. When the Markdown cell is executed, the LaTeX portions are automatically rendered in the HTML output as equations with high quality typography.\n",
      "\n",
      "* `Header cells` can provide a conceptual structure for your computational document as a whole using different levels of headings. There are 6 levels available, from level 1 (top level) down to level 6 (paragraph). As with Markdown cells, a heading cell is replaced by a rich text rendering of the heading when the cell is executed.\n",
      "\n",
      "* `Raw cells` provide a place in which you can write output directly. Raw cells are not evaluated by the notebook. When passed through nbconvert, raw cells arrive in the destination format unmodified. For example, this allows you to type full LaTeX into a raw cell, which will only be rendered by LaTeX after conversion by nbconvert.\n",
      "\n",
      "* `Code cells` take IPython input (i.e. Python code, `%magics`, `!system calls`, etc.) like IPython at\n",
      "the terminal or at the Qt Console.  The only difference is that in order to execute a cell, you *must*\n",
      "use `Shift-Enter`, as pressing `Enter` in `Edit mode` will add a new line of text to the cell.  When you type \n",
      "`Shift-Enter`, the cell content is executed, output displayed and the next cell is selected (or a new cell is created if the next one doesn't exist yet).  Try it now by putting your cursor on the next cell and typing `Shift-Enter`:"

So, it is strongly recommended to start the notebook server simply by typing `ipython notebook`, and then selectively turn on matplotlib support only for the notebooks you want by using the `%matplotlib` magic (see its docstring for details)."
